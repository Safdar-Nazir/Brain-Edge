This project consists of the Basic Elements of C++. It is created in CLion by JetBrains Inc.

Currently, there are four different problems in the project. I have attached problems below. 

When I will update the directory. I will also update this file.

                                                Problems:
Problem 1:
Write a program that can be used to assign seats for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with six
seats in each row. Rows 1 and 2 are first class, rows 3 through 7 are business class, and rows 8 through 13 are economy class.
Your program must prompt the user to enter the following information:
a. Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class)
b. Desired seat
Output the seating plan in the following form:

*Form

Here, * indicates that the seat is available; X indicates that the seat is occupied. 
Make this a menu-driven program; show the user’s choices and allow the user to make the appropriate choices.

Problem 2:
Jason, Samantha, Ravi, Sheila, and Ankit are preparing for an upcoming marathon. Each day of the week, 
they run a certain number of miles and write them into a notebook. At the end of the week, 
they would like to know the number of miles run each day, the total miles for the week, 
and average miles run each day. Write a program to help them analyze their data. 
Your program must contain parallel arrays: an array to store the names of the runners 
and a two-dimensional array of five rows and seven columns to store the number of miles run 
by each runner each day. Furthermore, your program must contain at least the following functions: 
a function to read and store the runners’ names and the numbers of miles run each day; a 
function to find the total miles run by each runner and the average number of miles run each day, 
and a function to output the results. (You may assume that the input data is stored in a file and 
each line of data is in the following form: 
runnerName milesDay1 milesDay2 milesDay3 milesDay4 milesDay5 milesDay6 milesDay7.)

Problem 3:
Write a program that uses a two-dimensional array to store the highest and lowest temperatures for each month of the year. 
The program should output the average high, average low, and the highest and lowest temperatures for the year. 
Your program must consist of the following functions:
a. Function getData: This function reads and stores data in the two-dimensional array.
b. Function averageHigh: This function calculates and returns the average high temperature for the year.
c. Function averageLow: This function calculates and returns the average low temperature for the year.
d. Function indexHighTemp: This function returns the index of the highest high temperature in the array.
e. Function indexLowTemp: This function returns the index of the lowest low temperature in the array.
(These functions must all have the appropriate parameters.)

Problem 4:
Task 4: Write a program to convert the time from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation and vice versa. 
Your program must be menu-driven, giving the user the choice of converting the time between the two notations. 
Furthermore, your program must contain at least the following function: a function to convert the time 
from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation, a function to convert the time from 12-hour notation to 24-hour 
notation, a function to display the choices, function(s) to get the input, 
and function(s) to display the results. (For 12-hour time notation, your program must display AM or PM.)
